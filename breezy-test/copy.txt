How to Make a Rustic Rope and Wood Tree Swing
We have a nice sized oak tree in our side yard that's been begging for a little rope swing. I did finally manage to put together a simple rope and wood swing for the tree.  Once I started on it, the swing together in no time at all.  I'm happy with my project and now I can show you how to make one too.

Would you like to make one too?  (or get someone else to make it for you?)  Here is how I did it:

Materials:

	•	2 by 6 piece of wood at least 6 foot long
	•	1 inch rope
	•	16- 3 inch screws 
	•	16 washers
	•	Stain or paint (optional)
	•	(drill, saw other misc tools)

Instructions: 

	1.	Cut the 2 by 6 in to 4 pieces.  2 that are 24 inches long and 2 that are 10 inches long.
	2.	Assemble the pieces as shown below, drilling the screws into the wood.  Use washers to ensure the screws don't come through to the other side.
	3.	Add distressing if desired and sand down the swing seat.
	4.	Use a 1 inch wood drill bit and drill 4 holes as shown:
	5.	Paint or stain if desired.Cut two pieces of rope, 6 feet long and thread through the holes of the swing seat, tying a secure knot at the end of the ropes under the seat.
	6.	Cut 2 more pieces of rope as long as you  need to reach your tree branch.  Attach one end of the rope to the tree using a secure knot and the other end to the tree swing using a hitch knot.  Repeat for the other side.


How easy was that?  Let me know if you make one!
